# Data for the VU ELC’s Supplement to Strong Inside
The [Vanderbilt University English Language Center] (VU ELC) has created supplementary resources for readers of *[Strong Inside: Perry Wallace and the Collision of Race and Sports in the South]*.

Our supplement includes the following digital tools:
